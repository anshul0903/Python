In this challenge, you will be given 2 integers, m and n. There are m words, which might repeat, in word group A. 
There are n words belonging to word group B. For each n words, check whether the word has appeared in group A or not. 
Print the indices of each occurrence of n in group A. If it does not appear, print -1.
Example
Group A contains 'a', 'b', 'a' Group B contains 'a', 'c'
For the first word in group B, 'a', it appears at positions  and  in group A. The second word, 'c', does not appear in group A, so print .
Expected output:
1 3
-1

Input:
5 2
a
