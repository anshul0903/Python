# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
n=int(input())
arr=input().split()
print(all(int(i)>=0 for i in arr) and any(i==i[::-1] for i in arr))

Statement:
You are given a space separated list of integers. If all the integers are positive, then you need to check if any integer is a palindromic integer.

In:
5
12 9 61 5 14 

Op:
True
since here 5 is pallandromic.
